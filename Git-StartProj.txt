#Adding existing project to GitHub from local Git

Step1: Crete new repo on GitHub, to avoid errors do not initialize repo with README, license or 'gitignore' ... can add these files later

Step2: On local system initialize project directory with 'git init'
	
Step3: Add files to local repo using 'git add .' and then commit changes using 
	'git commit -m "<type_your_msg>"'

Step4: Now to connect local repo to remote repo create a REMOTE using command:
	'git remote add <name_remote> <http_link_to_GitHub_repo>'
		...by convention default remote is "origin"
		...https link for perticular repo from website 
	'git remote -v'		
		...Verify new remote
	
Step5: Finally PUSH the project to GitHub using command
	'git push <remote_name> <branch_name>'
		...pushes changes to remote repo

#Clone the remote repo to local system

Step1: git clone <https_link_to_repo>
		...clones the remote repo to local system
		...similar for 'forked-repo'

	*when fork repo create new remote to manage the clone from local system:
		create remote uning command:
			'git remote add <REMOTE_NAME> <https_URL_FOR_FORK>'

#Creating new branch to make changes (keep master branch unaffected)

	*'git branch'		...displays local branch
	 'git branch -a' 	...all branched for the repo
	
	*'git checkput <REMOTE>/<BRANCH_NAME>' 
				...peek at branch
	 To track/work @local system 
	 'git checkout -b <local_BRANCH_NAME> <REMOTE>/<BRANCH_NAME>'
	
	*Can push changes to branch 
	 'git branch <LOCAL_BRANCH_NAME> -t <REMOTE>/<BRANCH_NAME>'

Step1: Pull changes from upstream, master branch should be updated

Step2: Crate new branch using:
	'git checkout -b <NEW_BRANCH_NAME>'

Step3: add and commit changes as always

Step4: Push changes to the GitHub using command:
	'git push <REMOTE_NAME> <BRANCH_NAME>'
		...Assumes same name for both local/remote repo
	
	 'git push <REMOTE_NAME> <local_BRANCH>:<remote_BRANCH>'

	*To UPDATE branch from remote to local system use command:
		'git fetch <REMOTE_NAME>'

	*To DELETE branch on local system:
		'git branch -d <BRANCH_NAME>'	...use D to force delete
	*To DELETE branch from GitHub:
		'git push <REMOTE_NAME> :[<BRANCH_NAME>]'
	*For more info on REMOTE:
		'git remote show <REMOTE_NAME>'
